#Software Necessary for MSCV Students
First of all, welcome to the Robotics Institute, Master of Science - Computer Vision program!
In the next 16 months, you will study, debug for, have food with and even sleep with Computer Vision!
In this tutorial, I will introduce some software necessary for you, MSCV students, including why we need them, where to get them and how to install them.
And for every software we mentioned here, we will cover all common operating systems: Windows, Linux, and Mac.

##MATLAB

MATLAB is software for mathematical computation, analysis, visualization, and algorithm development. 

Carnegie Mellon University Computing Services holds a campus agreement which covers faculty, staff and *students* for academic research, coursework, and teaching.

For more information about license, applications, toolboxes and blocksets available, MATLAB, SIMULINK and Toolboxes Licensing information, please visit [Computing Services](http://www.cmu.edu/computing/software/all/matlab/).

####Download

No matter which system OS you use, you can find appropriate MATLAB to your operating system at [Computing Services website](http://www.cmu.edu/computing/software/all/matlab/download.html).

####Installation

After downloading the MATLAB, you need to install it on your system.
The same, you can find the instructions of installation from [Computing Services website](http://www.cmu.edu/computing/software/all/matlab/installation.html).

Please follow the appropriate steps to your operating system.

##OpenCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.
OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.

The current version of OpenCV is  3.0.  But since many applications and algorithms are developed on OpenCV 2.4.  You might need to install both of them depending on what you are focusing on.

####Download

You can find different version of OpenCV including 2.4 and 3.0 for various operating systems including Windows, Linux/Mac, Android and iOS, on [OpenCV's website](http://opencv.org/downloads.html).

Please download the appropriate files to your own operating system.

####Installation

Due to different version of operating systems and different environment of your own operating system, it is highly possible that you would trapped into installing errors.
Hence, I put several tutorials here to instruct your own installation.
Please make sure that

* You have already installed all pre-requisite package before installing OpenCV.
* You complete the current step before going to the next, and tell yourself that any tiny error could result in the failure of the whole thing.
* Don't be worried if you have troubles.
* Google your troubles!

#####In Linux

* [The official OpenCV Installation Tutorial](http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_install/linux_install.html#linux-installation)

* [The OpenCV Installation Tutorial from Ubuntu Community](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenCV)

#####In Windows

* [The official OpenCV Installation Tutorial](http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/windows_install/windows_install.html#windows-installation)

* If you want to setup OpenCV with Visual Studio in Windows 7 (64-bit), visit [here](https://karanjthakkar.wordpress.com/2012/11/21/usin-opencv-2-4-2-with-visual-studio-2012-on-windows-7-64-bit/)
or [here](http://opencv-srf.blogspot.de/2013/05/installing-configuring-opencv-with-vs.html).

#####In Mac

Mac OSX is an Unix based operating system, and so the installation steps are similar to the Linux.
There is no instruction for Mac on the official OpenCV website.
So you can follow the steps for linux in official website.
But I recommend you to check the following tutorials that is tested for Mac.

* If you want to install OpenCV in Mac OSX Yosemite 10.10, please visit [here](http://blogs.wcode.org/2014/10/howto-install-build-and-use-opencv-macosx-10-10/).

* If you want more detailed instruction video for installing OpenCV 3.0.0 in Mac OS X Yosemite, visit [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U49CVY8yOxw).

* If you want to use Homebrew to install OpenCV 3 in Mac OSX Yosemite or build OpenCV 3 from source with CUDA support, visit [here](http://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv-3-on-yosemite-osx-10-10-x/).
This tutorial instructs you installing OpenCV 3.0 without messing up OpenCV 2.4.

* If you want to use macPort to install OpenCV 2.4 in Mac OSX Yosemite, visit [here](https://ceciliavision.wordpress.com/2014/10/28/installing-opencv-2-4-10-on-yosemite/).

* If you want to install OpenCV on Mac OS X Mountain Lion, visit [here](https://sites.google.com/site/yonasstephenfyp2013/updates/tutorialinstallingopencvonmacosxmountainlion).

##Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client
The Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client is desktop software that secures traffic between your computer and restricted campus services.
It is necessary for you to use MATLAB off campus.
Please download it from [Computing Services website](http://www.cmu.edu/computing/software/all/cisco-anyconnect/index.html).

##Python

Python, as an object-oriented programming language, is also popular in computer vision community.
It has efficient high-level data structures, elegant syntax, dynamic typing, and free extensive standard library.
Besides MATLAB, you might want to have a try with Python, or you have to use Python for understanding others' project.

####Download

Before you start, please check that you don't already have Python installed by entering `python` in a command line window.
If you see a response from a Python interpreter it will include a version number in its initial display.
If you need to install Python, please see [Python Download pages](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for the most up to date version.
If you are still not clear which file you should download, check the [BeginnersGuide/Download](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).

####Installation

Installing Python on Windows/Mac is pretty easy with doulbe click the file you downloaded, and then it's done.

Installing Python on Linux is also not complicated with several command lines.
After downloading the file, find `README` and open it.
You will get an over-complete instruction about how to install Python on your computer.
Please read them in detail, follow the instruction step by step, and then you are done.

####Python Libraries

Python is powerful due to the various powerful libraries.
You may not be familiar with python libraries, but no need to be panic!
Please read this guide [My top 9 Favorite Python Libraries for Building Image Search Engines](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/01/12/my-top-9-favorite-python-libraries-for-building-image-search-engines/), where the author explained in plain English why you need certain package, and listed links for downloading, installing and documents.

If you are not satisfied with the so-called 9 favorite Libraries (NumPy, SciPy, *etc*.) Please see [Installing Python Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html) for Python 3.x or [Installing Python Modules](https://docs.python.org/2/install/index.html) for Python 2.x.

####Quick Start

Assuming you have never touched Python before, let us learn Python from "Hello world!"
Please see [Learn Python: Tutorials](https://pythonspot.com) for detailed instructions.
