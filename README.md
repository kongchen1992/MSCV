#Software Necessary for MSCV Students
First of all, welcome to the Robotics Institute, Master of Science - Computer Vision program!
In the next 16 months, you will study, debug for, have food with and even sleep with Computer Vision!
In this tutorial, I will introduce some software necessary for you, MSCV students, including why we need them, where to get them and how to install them.
And for every software we mentioned here, we will cover all common operating systems: Windows, Linux, and Mac.

##MATLAB

MATLAB is software for mathematical computation, analysis, visualization, and algorithm development. 

Carnegie Mellon University Computing Services holds a campus agreement which covers faculty, staff and *students* for academic research, coursework, and teaching.
